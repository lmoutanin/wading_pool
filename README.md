# Epitech Wading Pool - Python Project

## Project context

This project was developed as part of an **Epitech Wading Pool** in Python.  
A Wading Pool is a short introductory project meant to help students discover the basics of a language or tool.  
Here, the goal is to get familiar with Python, virtual environments, and dependency management before working on more
advanced projects.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment  
   This isolates the project dependencies from the rest of your system.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment  
   This step allows you to use the environment you just created.

- On Linux / macOS:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On Windows (PowerShell):
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

3. Install dependencies  
   This installs all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
